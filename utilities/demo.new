nawk
 
"nawk" is an enhanced form of "awk".  We encourage
the use of nawk, even though the extra  facilities
it provides are not often needed!
 
nawk  [  program  ]  [ filename...]
nawk  [ -f program-file ] [ filename...]
 
Nawk scans every  input  filename  for  lines  that
match any  of  a  set  of  patterns  specified  in
program.
