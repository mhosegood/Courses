<blockquote> 
<p class="bdy"><i>My (Sun) ID Prom has failed. Can I use my machine? Can I replace 
the ID Chip with a regularly available chip, or do I have to wait for one to be 
made?</i></p>
</blockquote>
<IMG SRC="../img/sunface.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=177 WIDTH=85><span class="smlhd">ANSWER</span> 
<p class="bdy">Yes - you *can* use your machine. But you MAY need to enter its 
ethernet address and serial number each time you power it up.</p>
<p class="bdy">Here's an example for a Sparc 1+</p>
<ul>
<li class="bdy">Power up; when testing, hold stop key and enter "A" to give you 
the PROM monitor prompt of ">" 
<li class="bdy">Switch to new command mode by entering "n" and return 
<li><span class="bdy">In new command mode, enter the following:<br>
</span> 
<ul>
<span class="bdy"> 0 0 mkp<br>
8 0 20 a b c 53001234 mkpl<br>
^D^R </span> 
</ul>
<span class="bdy">Which sets up an ethernet address and serial number </span>
<li><span class="bdy">Boot the machine. For example, you might enter </span> 
<ul>
<span class="bdy"> old-mode<br>
b sd(0,2,0) </span> 
</ul>
<span class="bdy">To boot from the disc as SCSI target 2</span> 
<p> 
</ul>
<blockquote> 
<p class="bdy">For a permanent fix - yes, you can replace the PROM chip by a commercially 
available PROM; once you have done so, the commands listed above will cause the 
new settings to be saved. As sources may change, please email <a href="mailto:mick@firstalt.co.uk" class="bdylinks">Mick 
Hosegood</a> for current information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="smlhd">NOTES</p>

<ul>
<li class="bdy">The ethernet address (8 0 20 a b c) must be unique to each workstation 
on your network, so if you have (or have had) several systems fail, choose a different 
address for each! The "8 0 20" means Sun - don't change that; the "a b c" are 
three hex pair - so you have a huge choice; it would work equally well with "5 
3a 12" or "44 55 66", for example </li>
<li class="bdy">The hostid must also be unique to your network. The first four 
digits are usually the system type - on our example, 5300 is a Sparc Station 1+ 
- and must be correct: </li>
<ul>
<span class="bdy"> 5300 Sparc Station 1+<br>
5600 Sparc ELC<br>
5200 Sparc 1<br>
5500 Sparc 2<br>
80xx Classic, Sparc 4, Sparc 5 (2 digits only significant) </span> 
</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote> 
<p class="bdy">(see your system documentation for other values), and the last 
4 digits are a serial number.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><span class="bdy">If your system runs licensed software, you may need to use 
the same hostid and/or ethernet address that was burnt into the failed EEPROM. 
If you don't know what the settings were - sorry, you have a problem and may need 
the assistance of the software supplier.</span>
<li><span class="bdy"> ^D^R means "Control D, Control R". You are NOT prompted 
for this after you enter the previous line; the system looks as if it has hung!</span>
<li><span class="bdy">As of January 1997, PROM chips available are</span>
<ul>
<span class="bdy"> M48TO2-120PC1 (up to 120 MHz)<br>
M48TO2-150PC1 (up to 150 MHz)<br>
M48TO2-200PC1 (up to 200 MHz)</span>
