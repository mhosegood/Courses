<OL>
<LI class="bdy"><span class="bdy">Each device on an IP based ethernet needs to 
have a name. Since your workstation is going to be (in effect) TWO devices, you 
need to choose a second name. That second name needs to be added to the file </span><tt>/etc/hosts</tt><span class="bdy"> 
on the workstation, AND to the database on any name service systems that will 
include it in their domain.</span> <span class="bdy">Example. If you have a system 
known as "</span><tt>herring</tt><span class="bdy">" which responds to the IP 
address </span><tt>192.9.200.47</tt><span class="bdy">, and you also want it to 
respond to </span><tt>155.134.44.17</tt><span class="bdy"> as "</span><tt>jupiter</tt><span class="bdy">", 
the you will ensure that you have both the following lines in </span><tt>/etc/hosts:</tt> 
<UL>
<tt>192.9.200.47 herring</tt><BR>
<tt>155.134.44.17 jupiter</tt>
</UL><br>
<li class="bdy"><span class="bdy">You now need to choose which ethernet interface 
the second address will be used on.</span> 
<UL>
<li class="bdy"><span class="bdy">If it will be used on the SAME interface that 
you already use (for "</span><tt>herring</tt><span class="bdy">") in our example, 
then you run the ifconfig command to bring the second name into use, as follows:</span> 
<UL>
<TT>ifconfig le0:1 jupiter up</TT><br>
<span class="bdy">(in this example, the default interface has the name "</span><tt>le0</tt><span class="bdy">") 
</span>
</UL>
<LI><span class="bdy">If it will be used on a second interface, then you can run 
the ifconfig command as follow:</span> 
<UL>
<TT>ifconfig le1 jupiter up</TT><br>
<span class="bdy">(where "</span><tt>le1</tt><span class="bdy">" is the name of 
the second interface.)</span>
</UL>
</UL>
<span class="bdy"> At this point your system is responding to the second IP 
address, but:</span><UL>
<li class="bdy"><span class="bdy">It will NOT be routing information between networks</span>
<li class="bdy"><span class="bdy">The second interface will NOT restart if you reboot</span></UL>
<br> 
<li class="bdy"><span class="bdy">If you wish your work station to ROUTE IP packets 
between networks, then you need to create a file called "</span><tt>/etc/hostname.xyz</tt><span class="bdy">", 
containing just the name of the second interface ["</span><tt>xyz</tt><span class="bdy">" is the interface 
name]</span> 
<P><span class="bdy">In our example, the file will be called</span> 
<UL>
<TT>/etc/hostname.le0:1</TT><span class="bdy"> (for a second address on one interface)</span><BR>
<TT>/etc/hostname.le1</TT><span class="bdy"> (for a second interface)</span>
</UL>
<span class="bdy">and would (in either example) simple contain the word</span>
<UL>
<TT>jupiter</TT>
</UL>
<P><span class="bdy">You should then reboot the workstation, which will bring 
the extra IP address into use as the daemons restart, and it will also start the 
routing daemon "</span><tt>in.routed</tt><span class="bdy">" in the correct way.</span> 
<P><span class="bdy"> On our advanced Solaris 2 admin course, we go set up a machine 
as a router between two networks as one of the many practical exercise.</span>
<P> 
<LI class="bdy"><span class="bdy">If you do NOT wish your interface to route packets, 
we suggest that you do NOT create the extra "</span><tt>/etc/hostname</tt><span class="bdy">" files. Instead, 
you should modify your daemon startup scripts to include the "</span><tt>ifconfig</tt><span class="bdy">" 
commands described earlier at an appropriate point.</span><p>
<span class="bdy">As an example, you may wish to respond to a second IP address 
just to provide a web server at "arm's length" from the main tasks of the workstation. 
Here's a file - </span><tt>/etc/rc3.d/S30web.server</tt><span class="bdy"> - which we use on our Web Presence 
course to start the second IP address as well as the web server.</span>

<P class="bdy"> Once you have installed a file like this (do remember to edit 
it to meet your own needs), you should reboot your system in order to test it. 
</OL>
<p class="smlhd">NOTES</p>
<UL>
<LI><span class="bdy">Step 1 is ALWAYS necessary.</span>
<LI><span class="bdy">Step 2 is recommended for testing purposes, but CAN be omitted 
if you are confident and intend to do an immediate reboot.</span>
<LI><span class="bdy">Step 3 is only necessary if you wish your machine to be a router.</span>
<LI><span class="bdy">Step 4 is only necessary if you want your machine to restart the 
second IP address on reboot, but NOT act as a router.</span>
<LI><span class="bdy">The above has been tested on Solaris 2.5, and should also work 
on other recent Solaris 2 releases. On Solaris 1 (SunOS 4) the principle is similar, 
but there are differences - especially in step 4.</span>
